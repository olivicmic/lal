# Lal 1.0.0 Release Notes
## December 19, 2020

## New Features
* **FreeGeoIP ip lookup removed** - FreeGeoIP requires an API key so it has been removed since this is just a quick and simple collection of IP lookups.
* **Dependcy updates** - Gulp and other packages updated. Removed run-sequence and gulp-refresh. Replaced 'request' with Axios.
